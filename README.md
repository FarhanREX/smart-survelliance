Smart Surveillance Face Detection
This Python project utilizes OpenCV to detect faces using a webcam, save images with detected faces, and then compile the images into a video file. The program is designed to assist with simple, real-time home surveillance tasks by capturing images whenever a face is detected in the camera feed.

Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascades.
Automatic image saving with a timestamp for each detection.
Compilation of saved images into an MP4 video for easy review.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV library (cv2)
A connected webcam
